#  Stacked Overflow Developer Survey 2019 Analytics Project
**Overview**

In this project, I assume myself as a Data Analyst of a global IT and business consulting services company. I am analyzing data from Stacked Overflow Developer Survey 2019 about develpopers' choices of programming languages, databases, platforms, and web frames. My motivation to start this project lies on two reasons. First, this is a course from the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate and it is mandatory for me to complete. Second and more importantly, I want to know what developers think are the tools that shape the future.

**Project Description**

This project provides audience information about what programming languages, databases, platforms, and web frames developers are using and are expecting to develop in the future. In this project, I used Python programming language, its libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn as tools for wrangling, exploratory analyzing, and visualizing data. Furthermore, I also utilized SQL queries to help with a few visualizations. To summarize data into a dashboard, I used IBM Cognos Analytics and Microsoft PowerPoint. Overall, in the visualization process, there were many null values; and I have had to exclude them in the dashboards.
